:wave: Welcome to the **3<sup>rd</sup> Workshop and Challenge on
Computer Vision In The Built Environment For The Design, Construction and Operation of Buildings** organized at :wave: [<img class="rounded-rect" src="assets/imgs/cvpr2023.svg" width="400px" alt="cvpr2023"/>](https://cvpr2023.thecvf.com/) 
{: .text-center}

Building on the success of the previous two workshops, the 3rd Workshop on Computer Vision in the Built Environment continues on connecting the domains of Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) with that of Computer Vision by establishing a common ground of interaction and identify shared research interests. Specifically, this workshop focuses on the as-is semantic status of built environments and the changes that take place within them over time. These topics will be presented from the dual lens of Computer Vision and AEC-FM, highlighting the limitations and bottlenecks related to developing applications for this specific domain. The objective is for attendees to learn more about AEC-FM and the variety of real-world problems that, if solved, could have a tangible impact on this multi trillion dollar industry as well as the overall quality of life across the globe.

The workshop will begin by establishing ways to capture the as-is status of a space with expert speakers from both the AEC and Computer Vision domains. Attendees will be then introduced to the type of information required for the spatiotemporal analysis of our built environment in AEC, with a focus on effective management, safety, and the role of users in this process. Following that, the topic of scene understanding from 3D and 4D reconstructions will be presented. Finally, to close the loop from understanding real-world built environments to designing built environments better and faster, the topic of scene synthesis at a geometric and semantic level will be presented. The importance of closing the loop for the AEC industry is paramount, especially when considering the design paradox. Architects are designing living spaces without any feedback from their previous designs. Learning to design using data from spaces that are already occupied and in-use, can provide designers with insights on what makes spaces appropriate for supporting the quality of life of the users.

To further establish connections between the two domains and identify what we can do right now and what is still hard to solve, we will host the **3rd International Scan-to-BIM competition** targeted on acquiring the semantic as-is status of buildings given their 3D point clouds. Specifically, we will focus on the tasks of floorplan reconstruction and 3D building model reconstruction and present appropriate interdisciplinary metrics for solving them. The past two years we observed that a large gap remains before these problems can be considered solved and actually meet the needs of practitioners. We regard this workshop as the ideal environment for understanding the challenges and steps forward given that it provides convergence between the research and practical communities from multiple disciplines.

## :checkered_flag: **Challenge** {#challenge}
The workshop will host the 3rd International Scan-to-BIM challenge. The challenge will include the following tasks:

I. 2D Floorplan Reconstruction \
II. 3D Building Model Reconstruction

### 2D Floor Plan Reconstruction

The 2D Floorplan Reconstruction challenge contains a total of 31 buildings with multiple floors each and dozens of rooms on each floor. Of which, 20 buildings are designated as the training set, with a total of 49 point clouds. The validation and testing sets contain 5.5 buildings with 21 point clouds each. For each model, there is an aligned point cloud in LAZ format. For the training and validation sets, a corresponding floorplan aligned with the coordinate system of the point cloud is also provided. The 2D challenge is hosted on **[Codalab](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/12386)**. We have provided a **[Github repository](https://github.com/cv4aec/2d-floorplan-eval)** containing the evaluation code and metrics for floorplan reconstruction. The submission should be made in the same JSON format as in the provided ground truth. We include metrics to evaluate the reconstruction of the walls, doors, and columns, as well as floor area in 2D : 

1. **Geometric Metrics** \
    a. _IoU_ of each room (a room is defined as a completely separated area with walls and doors). \
    b. _Accuracy of endpoints_ : Precision/Recall at 3 different thresholds: 5cm, 10cm and 20cm, as well as the F-measure at each threshold will be evaluated in the coordinate system of the point cloud. The provided endpoints will be matched with the Hungarian algorithm to the point cloud, and every point that is within a certain threshold will be determined as a match. \
    c. _Orientation_ For each matched line between the ground truth, we will compute the cosine similarity metric between them as the normalized dot product. If a line is not matched with ground truth, the cosine metric will be zero. Finally, the metric will be averaged over all the ground truth lines.

2. **Topological Metrics** \
    a. _[Warping error](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5539950)_ : The warping error will first warp the predicted floorplan to the ground truth with a homotopic deformation, and then compute the pixels that cannot match after the deformation. \
    b. **_Betti number error_** : The Betti number error will compare the Betti numbers between the prediction and the ground truth and output the absolute value of the difference.

### 3D Building Model Reconstruction

The training data consists of 18 floors from 10 buildings. For each model, there is an aligned point cloud in LAZ format. The 3D building coordinates for walls, columns and doors are presented in 3 separate JSON files. We focus on the reconstruction of walls, columns, and doors. The 3D challenge is hosted on **[Codalab](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/12405)**. We have provided a **[Github repository](https://github.com/cv4aec/3d-matching-eval)** containing the evaluation code and metrics for building model reconstruction. The submission should be made in the same JSON format as in the provided ground truth. We evaluate the submissions on a variety of metrics : 

1. **3D IoU** of the 3D bounding box of each wall
2. **Accuracy of the endpoints** : Precision/Recall at 3 different thresholds: 5cm, 10cm and 20cm, as well as F-measure will be evaluated in the coordinate system of the point cloud. The provided endpoints will be matched with the Hungarian algorithm to the point cloud, and every point that is within a certain threshold will be determined as a match. We evaluate per each of the three semantic types (i.e., wall, column, door).

> We would like to note that ALL the submissions **need to be constructed automatically** . Manual reconstructions are against the spirit of this challenge and will not be allowed.

The challenge focuses on evaluating novel MDE techniques on the **SYNS-Patches** dataset proposed in [**this benchmark**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01489).
This dataset provides a challenging variety of urban and natural scenes, including forests, agricultural settings, residential streets, industrial estates, lecture theatres, offices and more.
Furthermore, the high-quality dense ground-truth LiDAR allows for the computation of more informative evaluation metrics, such as those focused on [**depth discontinuities**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01328v1).



The challenge is hosted on [**CodaLab**](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/7811). 
We have provided a [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/jspenmar/monodepth_benchmark) containing training and evaluation code for multiple recent SotA approaches to MDE.
These will serve as a competitive baseline for the challenge and as a starting point for participants.
The challenge leaderboards use the withheld validation and test sets for **SYNS-Patches**.
We additionally encourage evaluation on the public [**Kitti Eigen-Benchmark**](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_depth.php?benchmark=depth_prediction) dataset.

Submissions will be evaluated on a variety of metrics:
1. [**Pointcloud reconstruction**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08122): F-Score
2. [**Image-based depth**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06500): MAE, RMSE, AbsRel
3. [**Depth discontinuities**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01328v1): F-Score, Accuracy, Completeness

Challenge winners will be determined based on the **pointcloud-based F-Score** performance. -->
